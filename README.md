# BER_QPSK_Alamouti_2x2_Antenna
BER of QPSK Alamouti STBC with two transmit and receive (2x2) antenna for Wifi  802.11n  standard

A simple Space Time Code, suggested by Mr. Siavash M Alamouti in his landmark October 1998 paper â€“ A Simple Transmit Diversity Technique for Wireless Communication, Published in: IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications ( Volume: 16, Issue: 8, Oct 1998 ), offers a simple method for achieving spatial diversity with two transmit antennas.


Simulation BER of QPSK Alamouti STBC with two transmit and receive antenna
In this discussion, we will assume that the channel is a flat fading Rayleigh multipath channel and the modulation is QPSK.
